 TODO Popular Questions
 FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the
 number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

 Palindrome: Write a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase,
 number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

 Reverse a string: Write a program that takes a string as input and returns the same string in reverse order.

 Fibonacci sequence: Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The Fibonacci sequence
 is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

 Binary search: Write a program that implements the binary search algorithm to find a given number in a sorted array.

 Linked List: Implement a singly linked list and perform common operations such as adding, removing, and traversing nodes.

 Sorting algorithms: Implement one or more sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Merge Sort to sort
 an array of integers.

 Find the maximum value: Write a program that finds the maximum value in an array of integers.

 Anagram: Write a program that checks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or
 phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase.

 Factorial: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer
 n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
